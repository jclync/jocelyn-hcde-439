            <h3>January 24, 2022</h3><br />
            <p>Here is all the documentation for Assignment 2!<br /><br />
                For this assignment, I was tasked to:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>create a schematic for a circuit containing several LEDs and a button or tilt switch connected to Arduino</li>
                    <li>implement this circuit using a breadboard</li>
                    <li>write firmware in Arduino to make at least one of the LEDs fade</li>
                    <li>the code must use: 
                        <ul class="subbullet">
                            <li>a for-loop</li>
                            <li>digitalWrite()</li>
                            <li>digitalRead()</li>
                            <li>analogWrite()</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul><br /><br />
                I decided to create a <em>LED color selector</em> circuit &#128308; &#128994; &#128309; by using red, green, and blue LEDs.

                    for my circuit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Since I was using red, green, and blue LEDs for my circuit, I did two sets of calculations to determine what the appropriate 
                resistance to use for each LED: one for the red and green LEDs, and another set of calculations for the blue LED. For red, yellow, 
                and green LEDs, they all have <em>1.8V voltage drop</em>, and for blue, pink, and white LEDs, they all have <em>3.2 voltage drop</em>. The 
                desired current for all the LEDs I used was <em>20mA, or 0.02A</em> (found based on the datasheets for the LEDs). When calculating the 
                appropriate resistance to be used in the circuit, I started with calculating the voltage across. 
                <br />
                <strong>Red and Green LEDs:</strong> 
                Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 3.2V (5V - 1.8V drop = 3.2V across). Using the known voltage across and 
                the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=160&#8486; for resistance. To ensure 
                that I did not overload the LEDs and cause them to burn out, I decided to round up and use a <em>220&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic 
                above calculations). 
                <br />
                <strong>Blue LED:</strong> Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 1.8V 
                (5V - 3.2V drop = 1.8V across). Using the known voltage across and the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation 
                <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=90&#8486; for resistance. To decrease the brightness of the LED, I decided to round up and use a 
                <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic above calculations). 
                <br />
                <strong>RGB LED:</strong> For the RGB LED, I used the calculations 
                above for each corresponding color (red, green, and blue) for the LED. I decided to use a <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> for all three for 
                consistency with the Blue LED.
                <br />
                <strong>Buttons:</strong> For each button, I decided to use a <em>10k&#8486; resistor</em> as 10k resistors limit the current of buttons to a 
                lot less than the max current. For the button to work, we would need a nominal amount of current to flow, and the lower the amount, the less 
                power would be used (information from Prof Nadya in the class discord). 
            </p><br />
            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p> For my circuit, to make the traffic light, I used a red LED, yellow LED, and green LED.

            <p>Above is a code snippet of my Arduino code. For my code, I initialized the pins as OUTPUTs with their corresponding colors, with Pin3 for the Red LED, Pin4 
                for the Green LED, and Pin5 for the Blue LED using an array [] and for-loop. I initialized the buttons as INPUTs with Pin1 and Pin7. I used the loop() function to have the code run over and over 
                again forever. In this loop, I set the code to run when the fade button has not been pressed (using a while loop) so users can press the choose color button to choose a LED color 
                (red, green, or blue). When the choose color button is pressed, the red, green, and blue LEDs light up in a cycle every time the button is pressed using digitalWrite(). Once the user presses 
                the fade button, the RGB LED fades to the corresponding color that is chosen. I used digitalRead() to check the status of the button and see if the button was pressed 
                (ex: digitalRead(fade_pin) == HIGH) or not (ex: digitalRead(fade_pin) == LOW). I analogWrite() was used to fade the RGB LED by color mixing - important to note here that analogWrite() only works 
                with GPIO pins labeled with '~' (pins 3, 5, 9, 10, 11) -> I had the RGB LED connected to the pins 9, 10, and 11. View the arduino code
