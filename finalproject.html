            For my final project, I decided to make motion activated stair lights. I often trip on the stairs when it is dark (because I'm too lazy to try to find the light switch when it's dark), so I wanted to make lights for the stairs that turn on when it is dark and when motion is detected!

            <div class="images">
                <p class="imgcaption"><img src="finalproject/final-project-schematic-calculations.JPG" width=900px></a><br />Schematic and calculations 
                    for my final project.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Since I was using a red LED and the LED strip for my circuit, I calculated the appropriate 
                resistance to use for the red LED. And I did another set of calculations for seeing the amount of current used by the LED strip. For red, yellow, 
                and green LEDs, they all have <em>1.8V voltage drop</em>, and for blue, pink, and white LEDs, they all have <em>3.3 voltage drop</em>. The 
                desired current for the red LED I used was <em>20mA, or 0.02A</em> (found based on the datasheets for the LEDs). When calculating the 
                appropriate resistance to be used in the circuit, I started with calculating the voltage across. For the red LED, I decided to round up and use a 220 
                &#8486; resistor.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Red LED:</strong> 
                Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 3.2V (5V - 1.8V drop = 3.2V across). Using the known voltage across and 
                the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=160&#8486; for resistance. To ensure 
                that I did not overload the LEDs and cause it to burn out, I decided to round up and use a <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic 
                above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />  
                <strong>N-MOSFET Transistor: </strong> For the transistor, I connected the LED strip to it as the high-load output device. From looking at the datasheet for the transistor, the 
                LED strip box, and from the class lectures, I knew that the N-MOSFET transistor has a max drain current of 32A and Vdss (drain source voltage) of 60V. For the LED strips, it 
                contains 300 LEDs, and the LEDs are set up so that the strip groups 3 LEDs in series in a segment, and the segments are in parallel, so there are 100 segments in the strip. The LEDs have 3.3V drop (since they are white). For series 
                circuits, Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3, so the total voltage drop across one segment is 3*3.3 = 9.9V. Connecting the LED strip to 12V power supply means that there is 12-9.9=1.2Vacross. 
                The resistor in the segment is 240ohms. Using Ohm's Law to solve for current, I=V/R=2.1V/240ohms=0.00875A. For parallel circuits, Itotal=I1+I2+...+In. Since there are 100 segments, and each
                segment has the same current, so the total current for the LED strip is 0.00875*100 = 0.875A. 
                <br />--<br />  
                <strong>Photoresistor: </strong> For the photoresistor, I exposed the photoresistor to different intensity brightness to measure resistance. The measured 
                resistance I got from the multimeter was a range of around 1k-10k&#8486;, and I found that resistance decreased as brightness intensity increased. I found that when
                the multimeter measured around 10k&#8486; resistance, I measured 2.5V, and 5V when the photoresistor was exposed to really intense luminosity. For calculating R2, I 
                used the equation R2=(Vout*R1)/(Vin-Vout) using the values Vin=5V, Vout=2.5V, R1=10k&#8486;, and I calculated R2 to be 10k&#8486;.

            <h2>Project Execution</h2>
                <p> 
                To put everything together, I decided to construct a little box to hide the breadboard, Arduino, and wires. I cut up an old shoe box and used a pocky box to put the Arduino and breadboard. 
                So motion could be detected, I taped the PIR motion sensor module outside the box. I also taped the photoresistor to be poking out of the box as well to detect light intensity (if it is dark or bright).
                I used the red LED to show when the motion sensor was active (so the red LED turned on when it was dark).

                To make my box look a little nicer, I cut out white cardstock paper to line the outsides of the box, and I left the back open to be able to easily access the Arduino and breadboard.

            Above is a code snippet of my Arduino code. For my code, I initialized the pins for the LEDs as OUTPUTs, and the photoresistor as an INPUT.

            <p class="imgcaption"><img src="finalproject/final-project-code-flowchart.jpg" height=400></a><br />The way the stair lights are activated is through this flowchart. 
                First, the sensor value of the photoresistor is looked at: if the analog read value is less than 100 (it is dark), then the PIR motion sensor is activated and the 
                red LED is turned on (to indicate that the PIR motion sensor is active). If the analog read value is >= 100, then nothing happens (it is not dark). Then the PIR motion 
                sensor digital read value is looked at. If the PIR motion sensor value is HIGH, motion is detected, and the stair light (LED strip) turns on. To count how much time is left while the stair 
                light is on, the red LED blinks on and off 30 times, 1x per second. If the PIR motion sensor value is LOW, this means no motion is detected, and nothing changes.
