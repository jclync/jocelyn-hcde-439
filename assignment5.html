            <p>
            For my circuit, I used analogWrite() to change the brightness and colors of the RGB LED and LED strip. For the high-load output device, I used the LED strip, which I connected to an external power supply. For the input sensor,
            I used an abolute touch capacitive sensor.<br /><br />
  
            For this assignment, I decided to create a mini game inspired by Operation and Let's Go Fishin - and I created a pick-all-the-worms-without-picking-the-infected-worm game.<br /><br />
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> It's Presidents' Day and you decide to go out to have fun to take a break from midterms and homework. Since it's a nice day out, you decide to go fishing, but you 
            realize you have no more worms left to use as bait :(. The best worms are found in the white mud. But! There's a catch: one of the worms is infected with an autoimmune disease, and 
            if taken out of its home, it will retaliate by letting out a war cry and spraying a bright poison. Try to grab as many worms as you can without disturbing the infected worm. 
            If you pick the infected worm... it'll give you a little shock so beware! <br /><br />

            The way this game works is that the worms (aka wires) are stuck in the white mud (aka the upside down bowl). The player(s) pick the worms out of the mud. If the worm is a good worm, nothing will happen.
            If the worm is the infected worm (aka the wire for the capacitive sensor), the worm will release its bright poison (LED strip will start flashing) as well as let out its war cry (buzzer sound), and the RGB LED 
            will flash red, signaling the end of the game.

                <p class="imgcaption"><img src="a5/higher-voltage-transistors-schematic-calculations.JPG" width=900px></a><br />Schematic and calculations 
                    for my circuit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Since I was using red, green, and blue LEDs (in the RGB LED) for my circuit, I did two sets of calculations to determine what the appropriate 
                resistance to use for each LED: one for the red and green LEDs, and another set of calculations for the blue and white LEDs. For red, yellow, 
                and green LEDs, they all have <em>1.8V voltage drop</em>, and for blue, pink, and white LEDs, they all have <em>3.3 voltage drop</em>. The 
                desired current for all the LEDs I used was <em>20mA, or 0.02A</em> (found based on the datasheets for the LEDs). When calculating the 
                appropriate resistance to be used in the circuit, I started with calculating the voltage across. For each of the LEDs, I decided to use 220 
                &#8486; resistors to be consistent.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Red and Green LEDs:</strong> 
                Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 3.2V (5V - 1.8V drop = 3.2V across). Using the known voltage across and 
                the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=160&#8486; for resistance. To ensure 
                that I did not overload the LEDs and cause them to burn out, I decided to round up and use a <em>220&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic 
                above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>Blue LED:</strong> Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 1.7V 
                (5V - 3.3V drop = 1.7V across). Using the known voltage across and the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation 
                <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=90&#8486; for resistance. To decrease the brightness of the LED, I decided to round up and use a 
                <em>220&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>N-MOSFET Transistor: </strong> For the transistor, I connected the LED strip to it as the high-load output device. From looking at the datasheet for the transistor, the 
                LED strip box, and from the class lectures, I knew that the N-MOSFET transistor has a max drain current of 32A and Vdss (drain source voltage) of 60V. For the LED strips, it 
                contains 300 LEDs, and the LEDs are set up so that it groups 3 LEDS in series in a segment, and the segments are in parallel, so there are 100 segments in the strip. The LEDs have 3.3V drop (since they are white). For parallel 
                circuits, Vtotal = V1 + V2 + V3, so the total voltage drop across one segment is 3*3.3 = 9.9V. Connecting the LED strip to 12V power supply means that there is 12-9.9=1.2Vacross. 
                The resistor in the segment is 240ohms. Using Ohm's Law to solve for current, I=V/R=2.1V/240ohms=0.00875A. For parallel circuits, Itotal=I1+I2+...+In. Since there are 100 segments, and each
                segment has the same current, so the total current for the LED strip is 0.00875*100 = 0.875A. 
                <br />--<br />  
                <strong>Capacitive Sensor: </strong> I didn't do any calculations for the resistor used with the capacitive sensor, but from reading through the documentation, increase 
                in resistor values means more sensitivity with the capacitive touch, but at a tradeoff of speed (increase in resistance increases sensitivity, but makes it slower). 
                Here is a list of guidelines for resistor values and approximate sensitivity:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a 1 megohm resistor (or less maybe) for absolute touch to activate. *</li>
                    <li>With a 10 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 4-6 inches away.</li>
                    <li>With a 40 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 12-24 inches away</li>
                </ul>   
                <p>* I decided to use the 1 megohm resistor as I wanted to activate the capacitive sensor with absolute touch.</p>   
            </p><br />

            <p> For my circuit, to make the worm picker game, I used a RGB LED, capacitive sensor, and N-MOSFET Transistor.

                Above is a code snippet of my Arduino code. For my code, I initialized the pins for the LEDs as OUTPUTs. For the input sensor, I used the 
                capacitive sensor, and the capacitive touch values were used to fade the RGB LED and LED strip, as well as emit sound from the buzzer.
                If the capacitive sensor value was &#60; 1600, nothing would happen (the LED strip would stay off, and the RGB LED would stay at its 
                starting color and brightness. Else (capacitive sensor value was >= 1600), the LED strip and red color in the RGB LED would fade to a 
                fade value, and the buzzer would emit sound to a mapped frequency based on the fade value.
