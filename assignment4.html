            Building off of the LED color selector circuits that I had created for A2 and A3, I decided to adapt my previous color selector circuits to fade the 
            RGB LED to the chosen LED color &#128308; &#128994; &#128309; using <em>capacitive touch</em> &#129295; in the circuit.

                <p class="imgcaption"><img src="a4/libraries-schematic-calculations.JPG" width=900px></a><br />Schematic and calculations 
                    for my circuit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Since I was using red, green, and blue LEDs for my circuit, I did two sets of calculations to determine what the appropriate 
                resistance to use for each LED: one for the red and green LEDs, and another set of calculations for the blue LED. For red, yellow, 
                and green LEDs, they all have <em>1.8V voltage drop</em>, and for blue, pink, and white LEDs, they all have <em>3.3 voltage drop</em>. The 
                desired current for all the LEDs I used was <em>20mA, or 0.02A</em> (found based on the datasheets for the LEDs). When calculating the 
                appropriate resistance to be used in the circuit, I started with calculating the voltage across. For each of the LEDs, I decided to use 330 
                &#8486; resistors to be consistent.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Red and Green LEDs:</strong> 
                Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 3.2V (5V - 1.8V drop = 3.2V across). Using the known voltage across and 
                the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=160&#8486; for resistance. To ensure 
                that I did not overload the LEDs and cause them to burn out, I decided to round up and use a <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic 
                above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>Blue LED:</strong> Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 1.7V 
                (5V - 3.3V drop = 1.7V across). Using the known voltage across and the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation 
                <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=90&#8486; for resistance. To decrease the brightness of the LED, I decided to round up and use a 
                <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>RGB LED:</strong> For the RGB LED, I used the calculations 
                above for each corresponding color (red, green, and blue) for the LED. I decided to use a <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> for all three for 
                consistency with the other LEDs.
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>Photoresistor: </strong> For the photoresistor, I exposed the photoresistor to different intensity brightness to measure resistance. The measured 
                resistance I got from the multimeter was a range of around 1k-10k&#8486;, and I found that resistance decreased as brightness intensity increased. I found that when
                the multimeter measured around 10k&#8486; resistance, I measured 2.5V, and 5V when the photoresistor was exposed to really intense luminosity. For calculating R2, I 
                used the equation R2=(Vout*R1)/(Vin-Vout) using the values Vin=5V, Vout=2.5V, R1=10k&#8486;, and I calculated R2 to be 10k&#8486;.  
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>Capacitive Sensor: </strong> I didn't do any calculations for the resistor used with the capacitive sensor, but from reading through the documentation, increase 
                in resistor values means more sensitivity with the capacitive touch, but at a tradeoff of speed (increase in resistance increases sensitivity, but makes it slower). Here is a list of guidelines for resistor values and approximate sensitivity:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a 1 megohm resistor (or less maybe) for absolute touch to activate. *</li>
                    <li>With a 10 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 4-6 inches away.</li>
                    <li>With a 40 megohm resistor the sensor will start to respond 12-24 inches away</li>
                </ul>        
                <p>* I decided to use the 1 megohm resistor as I wanted to activate the capacitive sensor with absolute touch.</p>    
            </p><br />
            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p> For my circuit, to make the LED color chooser circuit, I used a red LED, green LED, blue LED, a RGB LED, potentiometer, and photoresistor.

            <p> 
                Above is a code snippet of my Arduino code. For my code, I initialized the pins as OUTPUTs with their corresponding colors, with Pin3 for the Red LED, Pin5 
                for the Green LED, and Pin6 for the Blue LED using an array [] and for-loop. For the RGB LED, I set them to pins 9-11 and intialized them as OUTPUTs. I used 
                analogRead() to read in the analog in values from the photoresistor (which I connected to the analog pin A0). From the analog in values that were read in, 
                I used them to choose an LED color based on which LED was turned on (If the analog in value was >= 600, the red LED would be on. If the analog in value was between 350 and 600, the green 
                LED would be on. If the analog in value was less than 350, the blue LED would be on). To fade the RGB LED to the chosen color, I used the capacitive sensor and an if-statement. I used the 
                if-statement to increase fade the RGB to the chosen color using map() and constrain() to calibrate the capacitive sensor input readings to a range of 0-255 to set a brightness of the RGB 
                LED using analogWrite().
