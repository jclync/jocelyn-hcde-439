            For my circuit, I decided to make an interactive game using the joystick. I used the joystick as my input devices, and LEDs as my output devices. 
            The program works by using the joystick to choose a color for Rudolph's nose. Pressing certain keys on the keyboard change the lights to make them into party lights -> 'p' makes the LEDs fade 10 times, 'b' makes the red, green, and blue LEDs blink 5 times, and space makes the LEDs all turn off.

            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <div class="images">
                <p class="imgcaption"><img src="a6/talking-to-the-web-schematic-calculations.JPG" width=900px></a><br />Schematic and calculations 
                    for my circuit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Since I was using red, green, and blue LEDs (in the RGB LED) for my circuit, I did two sets of calculations to determine what the appropriate 
                resistance to use for each LED: one for the red and green LEDs, and another set of calculations for the blue and white LEDs. For red, yellow, 
                and green LEDs, they all have <em>1.8V voltage drop</em>, and for blue, pink, and white LEDs, they all have <em>3.3 voltage drop</em>. The 
                desired current for all the LEDs I used was <em>20mA, or 0.02A</em> (found based on the datasheets for the LEDs). When calculating the 
                appropriate resistance to be used in the circuit, I started with calculating the voltage across. For each of the LEDs, I decided to use 330 
                &#8486; resistors to be consistent.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Red and Green LEDs:</strong> 
                Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 3.2V (5V - 1.8V drop = 3.2V across). Using the known voltage across and 
                the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=160&#8486; for resistance. To ensure 
                that I did not overload the LEDs and cause them to burn out, I decided to round up and use a <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic 
                above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>Blue LED:</strong> Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 1.7V 
                (5V - 3.3V drop = 1.7V across). Using the known voltage across and the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation 
                <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=90&#8486; for resistance. To decrease the brightness of the LED, I decided to round up and use a 
                <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic above calculations).

            joystick, and I used LEDs as the output devices.
