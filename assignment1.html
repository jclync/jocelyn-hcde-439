            <h1>Assignment 1 - Blink!!</h1>
            <p>Here is all the documentation for Assignment 1!<br /><br />
                For this assignment, I was tasked to:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>create a schematic for a circuit containing at least 3 LEDs connected to Arduino</li>
                    <li>implement this circuit using a breadboard</li>
                    <li>write firmware in Arduino to make the LEDs blink in a pattern</li>
                </ul><br /><br />
                I decided to create a <em>traffic light</em> &#128678; by using red, yellow, and green LEDs.

            <p>Since I was using red, yellow, and green LEDs for my circuit, I did one set of calculations to determine what 
                the appropriate resistance to use for each LED. For red, yellow, and green LEDs, they all have <em>1.8V drop</em>, and 
                the desired current for each of the three LEDs was <em>20mA, or 0.02A</em>(found based on the datasheets for the LEDs). When 
                calculating the appropriate resistance to be used in the circuit, I started with calculating the voltage across. 
                Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 3.2V (5V - 1.8V drop = 3.2V across). Using 
                the known voltage across and the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value 
                R=160&#8486; for resistance. To ensure that I did not overload the LEDs and cause them to burn out, 
                I decided to round up and use a <em>220&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic above calculations).
            </p><br />
            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p> For my circuit, to make the traffic light, I used a red LED, yellow LED, and green LED.

            <p>For my Arduino code, I initialized the pins with their corresponding colors, with Pin13 for the Red LED, Pin7 
                for the Yellow LED, and Pin1 for the Green LED. I used the loop() function to have the code run over and over 
                again forever. In this loop, I set the LEDs to alternate from green to yellow to red by turning the 
                corresponding LEDs on by setting the voltage to HIGH or off by setting the voltage to LOW. View the arduino code
