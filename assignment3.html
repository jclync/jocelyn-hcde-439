            <p>
            Building off of the LED color selector circuit I had created for A2, I decided to create a mood-centered <em>LED color selector</em> circuit &#128308; &#128994; &#128309; in conjunction 
            with a light sensor &#9728; by using red, green, blue, and RGB LEDs, as well as a photoresistor and potentiometer. Users can select a LED color based on their mood, and a corresponding message
            will be printed out when the LED color is changed.

                <p class="imgcaption"><img src="a3/inputoutput-schematic-calculations.JPG" width=900px></a><br />Schematic and calculations 
                    for my circuit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Since I was using red, green, and blue LEDs for my circuit, I did two sets of calculations to determine what the appropriate 
                resistance to use for each LED: one for the red and green LEDs, and another set of calculations for the blue LED. For red, yellow, 
                and green LEDs, they all have <em>1.8V voltage drop</em>, and for blue, pink, and white LEDs, they all have <em>3.3 voltage drop</em>. The 
                desired current for all the LEDs I used was <em>20mA, or 0.02A</em> (found based on the datasheets for the LEDs). When calculating the 
                appropriate resistance to be used in the circuit, I started with calculating the voltage across. For each of the LEDs, I decided to use 330 
                &#8486; resistors to be consistent.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Red and Green LEDs:</strong> 
                Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 3.2V (5V - 1.8V drop = 3.2V across). Using the known voltage across and 
                the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=160&#8486; for resistance. To ensure 
                that I did not overload the LEDs and cause them to burn out, I decided to round up and use a <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic 
                above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>Blue LED:</strong> Knowing that the Arduino gives 5V, I calculated the voltage across as 1.7V 
                (5V - 3.3V drop = 1.7V across). Using the known voltage across and the desired current, I then used Ohm's Law with the equation 
                <strong>V=IR</strong> to get a value R=90&#8486; for resistance. To decrease the brightness of the LED, I decided to round up and use a 
                <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> (shown in schematic above calculations). 
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>RGB LED:</strong> For the RGB LED, I used the calculations 
                above for each corresponding color (red, green, and blue) for the LED. I decided to use a <em>330&#8486; resistor</em> for all three for 
                consistency with the other LEDs.
                <br />--<br />
                <strong>Photoresistor and Potentiometer (Voltage Dividers)</strong> For the photoresistor and potentiometer, I decided to use a <em>10k&#8486; resistor</em>. 
                Using the multimeter, I had measured a reading of 10k&#8486; resistance when the potentiometer knob was turned to the very right. I also used the multimeter 
                to read the voltage of the potentiometer, which I found to have a range of 2.5V-5V. Using these values, I used the equation <strong>R2 =(Vout*R1)/(Vin-Vout)</strong>
                to get a value of 10k&#8486;. For the photoresistor, I exposed the photoresistor to different intensity brightness to measure resistance. The measured 
                resistance I got from the multimeter was a range of around 1k-10k&#8486;, and I found that resistance decreased as brightness intensity increased. I found that when
                the multimeter measured around 10k&#8486; resistance, I measured 2.5V, and 5V when the photoresistor was exposed to really intense luminosity. For calculating R2, I 
                used the same calculations as I did for the potentiometer of Vin=5V, Vout=2.5V, R1=10k&#8486;, and I calculated R2 to be 10k&#8486;.  
            </p><br />
            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <p> For my circuit, to make the LED color chooser circuit, I used a red LED, green LED, blue LED, a RGB LED, potentiometer, and photoresistor.

            <p> 
                Above is a code snippet of my Arduino code. For my code, I initialized the pins as OUTPUTs with their corresponding colors, with Pin3 for the Red LED, Pin5 
                for the Green LED, and Pin6 for the Blue LED using an array [] and for-loop. For the RGB LED, I set them to pins 9-11 and intialized them as OUTPUTs. I used 
                analogRead() to read in the analog in values from the potentiometer (which I connected to the analog pin A5) and photoresistor (connected to analog pin A0). 
                From the analog in values that were read in, I used the map function and constrain() to calibrate the values that were read in to map it to the range of the 
                analog out to write to the LED for output (range of values 0 to 255 for the LEDs). I wanted to increase the brightness of the RGB LED when the photoresistor 
                input value decreased (light intensity brightness decreased aka less bright). I used the if-statement to increase the LED brightness using analogWrite() 
                when the photoresistor input sensor value detected less light (I chose to use 650 as the threshold value).
